## Problem Statement

To build a machine learning model that accurately classifies Iris flowers into their respective species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Introduction
- Iris Flower

The Iris flower is a genus of blooming plants in the Iridaceae family that includes approximately 300 species. These flowers are known for their vibrant colours and patterns, which make them popular in gardens and floral arrangements around the world. The Iris dataset used for this project categorises three species based on the following measurements:

Sepal: The outermost part of the flower, usually green and protecting.
Petals: The interior, generally bright, components of the flower are utilised to attract pollinators.

- Project

This project intends to create a machine-learning algorithm that will categorise Iris flowers into species based on sepal and petal measurements. The dataset utilised is the well-known Iris dataset, which includes measurements of 150 Iris blooms from three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Conclusion
The Iris Flower Classification project successfully used machine learning algorithms to categorise Iris flowers into species based on sepal and petal dimensions. The project achieved excellent accuracy in predicting species from unseen data by conducting extensive data exploration, visualisation, and model training with logistic regression. Visualisations such as pair plots and box plots provided valuable insights into feature correlations and species distinction, highlighting the dataset's suitability for classification tasks. This project not only demonstrated excellent model deployment and performance evaluation, but it also laid the groundwork for future improvements and applications in similar categorization projects.
